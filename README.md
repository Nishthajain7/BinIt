## Project Details

### Overview
Binit is a community-driven waste management platform that empowers users to report garbage with photos and location details. Cleaners then take action, clean the area, and upload images of the cleaned space, ensuring transparency and accountability in the process.

### Problem Statement
Improper waste disposal is a growing urban challenge, leading to environmental degradation and health hazards. A lack of efficient reporting mechanisms and accountability further exacerbates the issue, leaving public spaces polluted.

### Solution
Binit provides a seamless platform where users can easily report garbage through geotagged photos. Assigned cleaners are notified and take action, documenting the cleaned areas for accountability. Additionally, we encourage institutions to participate by organizing competitions to promote community engagement.
